# Aerodynamic-propeller-simulation-tool
This is a Python tool. Designed using the BEM theory to compute key performance metrics for propeller aerodynamic behaviour
High-Efficiency Propeller Design for Human-Powered Aquatic Vehicle. This project involved the complete design and validation of a high-efficiency propeller, optimized for a human-powered aquatic vehicle. It covered the full engineering workflowâ€”from aerodynamic modeling and simulation to physical prototyping and lab testing.
